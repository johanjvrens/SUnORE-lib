SUnORE Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a SUnORE-community-maintained repository of code snippets. [SUnORE](http://sunore.co.za).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

## Submitting Your Snippet

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code snippets. If you would like to submit your snippet, please [fork](https://github.com/johanjvrens/lib/fork) the repository and then create a [pull request](https://github.com/johanjvrens/lib/compare/).

Please refer to the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/johanjvrens/lib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull request.
